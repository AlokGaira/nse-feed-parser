short-description: a real-time data compression library
info-description: \
  LZO is a portable lossless data compression library written in ANSI C. \
  It offers pretty fast compression and very fast decompression. \
  Decompression requires no memory. In addition there are slower \
  compression levels achieving a quite competitive compression ratio \
  while still decompressing at this very high speed.
